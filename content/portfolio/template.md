**example of block text**

>An unordered list is a simple bullet list. There's not much to an unordered list. It must be separated from a text block by one blank line and each list item must be preceded by a hyphen, plus or asterisk. I use hyphen characters ("-") exclusively for bullet lists. I have run into problems when using a mix of hyphens and asterisks with lists.

>To create nested lists, indent by one tab (or four spaces if you're antediluvian. Markdown processors will automatically vary the bullet character between list levels. That's the main reason it doesn't matter much whether I use an asterisk or dash for bullets.
